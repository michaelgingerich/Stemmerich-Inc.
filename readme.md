I had created this project with my team for Stemmerich, Inc., as one requirement of the capstone project in Information Systems 4850 at University of Missouri - St. Louis.  The application transferred data from Sage 50 to SQL Server and monitored inventory to provide alerts for the thresholds set by the user.
