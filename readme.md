This project is comprised of two C# Windows form applications that I coded for Stemmerich, Inc. as part of a capstone project for Information Systems 4850 at University of Missouri - St. Louis.  I coded the first application in order to select and output order data from Sage 50, and in order to select, output, and insert order and inventory data to and from SQL Server.  The second application was coded in order to select inventory data from SQL Server, and in order to send notification messages when threshold was reached.  The applications implement configuration file encryption, in order to secure connection strings.
